/*

  Quick JS by Jason @ freakdesign to enable a persistent cart

  Drop this into a Liquid template rather than a js.liquid or js asset. 
  That's important since there's a hmac_sha256 filter that needs to run 
  against the customer id.

  Questions? Ping me on twitter: @freakdesign

  Relates to blog post:

  Example: (not yet, soon...)
